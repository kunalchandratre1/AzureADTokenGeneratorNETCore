# AzureADTokenGeneratorNETCore
Console application for Azure AD token generator .NET core code 

Change is inevitable. With .NET Framework becoming legacy and .NET core stated as future; many migration projects are getting triggered. Also for new projects, development choice is .NET core by default.

Last year in April 2019 I wrote a blog post on How to create service principal or App registration in Azure AD.

By far this is one of the most visited blog post I have written. Reason is simple. Any application today getting deployed on Azure needs Azure AD token to be generated through application. This helps in performing management tasks against Azure environment; and hence it is crucial.

The last year blog is based on .NET framework.

With .NET core becoming more and more obvious choice, I thought it is time to have new blog post and new code base for â€œ.NET core based Azure AD Token generator using Service principal.
